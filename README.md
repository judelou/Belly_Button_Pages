# Belly_Button_Pages
Deploying the app to GitHub Pages


This code took me a very long time to develop.
I worked on it on and off for two months. 
I was able to create the individual graphs; however, linking them together proved to be difficult.  
Another obstacle that I faced was updating the graphs. 
I was able to go to office hours, askBCS, and chat GPT to synthesis my code, atlthough I did get many diferent ideas I was eventually able to come up with something.
